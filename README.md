* Login-Signup Project in node.js
-In this project I used promises and callback for understanding.
 Sign-up:-
  *fistly user ask username and password for checking if username is exit in jsonFile.
  * if username is in jsonfile it will show user name is already exit.
  * then first-password and secondpassword both are equal so password is correct 
  * if both password are not equal so password is not correct.
  * validation password - @ or # should be there.
  * After the signup it will ask about more details.
Log-in:-
  * user Ask userName and password if username and password same so login successfully otherwise password is not vaild.
